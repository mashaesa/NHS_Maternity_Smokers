## 🔍 **Key Findings**  

📌 **Highest percentage of smokers during maternity:**  
✔ **Nottingham and Nottinghamshire (14.02%)** - The highest recorded rate across NHS regions.  
✔ **Lincolnshire (12.92%)** and **North East & North Cumbria (12.08%)** also reported elevated smoking rates.  

📌 **Significant ‘Smoking Status Unknown’ cases:**  
✔ **Devon reported the highest unknown smoking status at 20.35%**, raising concerns about data collection reliability.  

📌 **Regional disparities in smoking trends:**  
✔ **The North East & Yorkshire had the highest percentage of smokers**, while **London recorded the lowest smoking rates**.  
✔ **Cultural, socio-economic, and policy-related factors contribute to these disparities.**

## **📊 Smoking and Maternity Report: Key Findings & Analysis**  

### **1️⃣ Highest Percentage of Smokers: Nottingham and Nottinghamshire (14.02%)**  
📌 **Possible Causes:**  
- Socio-economic factors, including **lower household income** and **higher deprivation rates**.  
- **Limited access to smoking cessation resources** compared to other regions.  
- **Behavioural and cultural influences** that impact smoking habits.  

🚀 **Recommendations for Reducing Smoking in Nottinghamshire:**  
✔ **Increase NHS funding for local smoking cessation programmes**.  
✔ **Enhance public awareness campaigns on the risks of smoking during pregnancy**.  
✔ **Improve accessibility to nicotine replacement therapies (NRTs) for expectant mothers**.  
✔ **Incorporate smoking cessation support into routine maternity care visits**.

### **2️⃣ High Number of ‘Smoking Status Unknown’ in Devon**  
📌 **Key Finding:**  
- **20.35% of cases in Devon had unknown smoking status**, significantly impacting the accuracy of maternity smoking data.  

📌 **Possible Causes:**  
- **Incomplete or inconsistent data entry** by healthcare professionals.  
- **Expectant mothers unwilling to disclose smoking habits** due to social stigma.  
- **Lack of standardised data collection protocols** across different NHS trusts.  

🚀 **Recommendations to Improve Data Collection in Devon:**  
✔ **Standardise NHS reporting protocols for smoking status during maternity care**.  
✔ **Train healthcare professionals on better data collection techniques**.  
✔ **Introduce a non-judgmental approach in consultations** to encourage honest disclosures.  
✔ **Integrate electronic health records (EHRs) with mandatory smoking status fields**.

### **3️⃣ Regional Smoking Disparities: North East & Yorkshire vs. London**  
📌 **Key Observations:**  
- **The North East & Yorkshire had the highest percentage of smokers during maternity.**  
- **London had the lowest overall percentage, indicating better smoking cessation support.**  

📌 **Possible Causes of Disparities:**  
- **Lower income levels and higher deprivation rates in Northern regions.**  
- **Greater access to smoking cessation programmes and awareness campaigns in London.**  
- **Cultural and behavioural differences influencing smoking habits.**  

🚀 **Policy Recommendations for Addressing Regional Disparities:**  
✔ **Expand targeted public health campaigns in high-risk regions.**  
✔ **Provide additional NHS support for pregnant women in deprived areas.**  
✔ **Conduct case studies on successful smoking cessation initiatives in London and apply these strategies to high-smoking regions.**  
✔ **Develop a nationwide NHS maternity smoking reduction strategy focusing on Nottinghamshire, the North East, and Yorkshire.**

## **📊 Data Science Enhancements for Future Analysis**  

📌 **Key Data Issues Identified:**  
✔ **Gaps in smoking status reporting affect trend accuracy.**  
✔ **Lack of external socio-economic variables in smoking trend modelling.**  
✔ **Absence of real-time data tracking for maternity smoking rates.**  

🚀 **Future Data Science Improvements:**  
✔ **Integrate machine learning models to predict high-risk maternity smoking cases.**  
✔ **Use clustering techniques (K-Means, DBSCAN) to segment regions based on smoking trends.**  
✔ **Enhance data collection methods using AI-driven survey analysis.**  
✔ **Incorporate external socio-economic data for deeper insights.**  
✔ **Automate reporting dashboards to ensure real-time updates on smoking trends.**

## 💰 **Policy Recommendations & Revenue Impact for NHS**  

🚀 **Estimated Reduction in Smoking Rates if Strategies Are Implemented:**  
✔ **Targeted cessation programmes: 10%-15% decrease in high-risk regions.**  
✔ **Improved data collection: 5%-8% more accurate smoking status reporting.**  
✔ **Public awareness campaigns: Potential to reduce maternity smoking rates by 7%-12%.**  

📌 **Impact on NHS Resources:**  
✔ **Lower maternity complications related to smoking.**  
✔ **Reduction in long-term healthcare costs associated with neonatal conditions.**  
✔ **Better allocation of NHS funding based on more accurate data.**  

📌 **Next Steps for NHS Implementation:**
